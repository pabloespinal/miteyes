# CAT EYS

## This project was built as fun assignment to learn how to follow objects so that it can mimmic the computer mouse movement.

## This portfolio allows me to have my first hand practice on maneging shapes and color using CSS and Javascript.

# I learned how to integrate a shape inside another shape in CSS

# Main challanges I encounterd were the dimenssions and integration of the objects created with CSS and Javascript.
